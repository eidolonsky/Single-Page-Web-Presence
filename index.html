      About Me
    </h2>

      I'm a Chinese student, studying on Technical Communication and Information Design at IIT. Also, I am a photographer focusing on scenic, nature, architecture and BIRDS. I have several experiences as a journalist, editor, photographic journalist and graphic editor. Currently. Big fan of Liverpoolfc.

    <h3>
      Background
    </h3>
    <p>
      I got my bachelor degree from SJTU(<a href="http://www.sjtu.edu.cn">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>) majored in Communication. My study on communication is mostly in the form of theories and practice in traditional media(newspaper, magazine, TV) and journalism. I spent six months on an exchange program in SU(<a href="http://su.se">Stockholm University</a>). Most of my internships were as journalist and editor. I used to cover the job ranging from writing news to editing passages, from photographing to graphic design. And not being glad to recall the memory, I also spent three months interning in the marketing department of SMG(<a href="www.smg.cn">Shanghai Media Group</a>).
    </P> 
    <p>
      All these happened before my graduation from SJTU, and I was thinking about the future about dipping in the traditional media industry. Finally, I decided to seek chance to further my study in communication with more emphasis on Internet and web. So, I came to IIT(<a href="web.iit.edu">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>), studying Technical Communication and Information Design.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ambitions
    </h4>
    <p>
      I take the hope of enhancing my abilities technically and broaden my horizons and knowledge in communication and information technology. With only several internship experiences, I would like to grab the opportunity of more communication practices to lay the foundation for my future careers.
